					<description><![CDATA[I had this same issue with Designer2007. When working with a master page, after a while it began hanging on to this &#039;checked out&#039; status and would give me trouble when trying to make further edits. I was editing/testing this master page and so i needed to constantly check in/out and when this glitch started it became a real pain. I didn&#039;t fix it but worked around it by closing the document, and then reopening the document which would clear the &#039;checked out&#039; status, and then would be able check out again.]]></description>
