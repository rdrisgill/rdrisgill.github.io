					<description><![CDATA[How does this work in a V4 master that is mostly customized by an attached CSS file?

I used a V4 master to create a system master customized by css. The modal window is now very wide. When I used &quot;s4-notdlg&quot; in the body container, the site went to full width and the scroll bar didn&#039;t work. I tried using your modal script here but it didn&#039;t work.

.ms-dialog #s4-bodyContainer {
margin:0px !important;
width:auto !important;
height:auto !important;
padding: 0px !important;
}]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keep in mind, using a custom master in SP2010 will kill people picker fields and lookup columns in lists.  Since the custom master will render in IE9, the switch back to IE8 for NewForm.aspx and EditForm.aspx does not happen.  It&#039;s a known bug which renders the use of custom master pages useless in SharePoint.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used the class=&quot;s4-notdlg&quot; in those divs but I am getting dialog boxes that are empty, just have just the background of my custom page, no content in them.

I looked at the padding, height and width of my wrapper (container) and there is nothing that seems to interfere:
.wrapper {
	width: 1060px;
	background: #fff;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

I don&#039;t know why I am getting empty dialog boxes. Can you help?

					<description><![CDATA[I might need to see a screenshot of whats going on. I have seen instances where you need to add extra CSS to get rid of padding and widths from custom branding that are applying to dialogs. I&#039;m not sure if this is what you mean buf for that I add CSS like this (customBody is my main page container):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.ms-dialog .customBody {&lt;br /&gt; margin:0px !important;&lt;br /&gt; width:auto !important;&lt;br /&gt; height:auto !important;&lt;br /&gt; padding: 0px !important;&lt;br /&gt;}]]></description>
