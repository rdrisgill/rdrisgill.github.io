<p>Also, in the coming days/weeks I will be removing the veil of secrecy surrounding my true identity. Truth is, the only reason I started this pseudonym was because I was never sure what my employers policy on work blogging was. In related news I have a book coming out in September with Wrox entitled &#8220;Professional SharePoint 2007 Design&#8221;. This book will be focused on just the design and branding process with SharePoint. The Amazon page for the book lists my true identity (and a photo of my face!). Can anyone guess which author I am?</p>

You click your mood from a dial selector and then random intriguing videos and images fade in and out over a soundtrack that matches.
