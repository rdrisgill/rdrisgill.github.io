										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of the sudden my IE7 was going crazy visiting many popular blogging services including Lifehacker and Gizmodo. It pops up this &#8220;Operation Aborted&#8221; error and then immediately clears the page when you click OK (which is super annoying). After trying to turn off and on my plugins and going a little bit crazy, it turns out that this is a problem that the IE8 team is aware of and have fixed in the latest beta. Its related to javascript page rewrites after the page has loaded. Apparently SiteMeter, a popular website traffic analysis tool was throwing this error all over the web for the past few days. So rest assured the problem most likely isn&#8217;t your PC, its probably SiteMeter or some other Javascript.</p>
