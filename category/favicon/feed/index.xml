<p>My buddy John Ross had asked me if I knew anything about adding Favicons to SharePoint branding, so this post is for him. He pointed me to this post on <a href="http://mindsharpblogs.com/kathy/archive/2006/11/27/1384.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindSharp Blogs</a>. This method didn&#8217;t work for him when he tried it so was wondering how I did one for a project we worked on. I think the method in that post technically should work as IIS will pickup favicons that are in your IIS root, but I think SharePoint may be blocking access in some instances. For me, in traditional html, I have always preferred to call out favicons specifically with a <link> tag in the html <head> this way I ensure that my code, not the server, is handling the file. So now, how do you do this in SharePoint? Here are my steps</p>
<p>Drag a favicon.ico file to the Images directory of your MOSS site with SharePoint designer.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>I have created a simple favicon.ico for you to      try: <a href="http://209.208.125.75/~randy/images/favicon.ico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right Click and Save This Link</a>  <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" border="0" width="16" height="16" src="http://209.208.125.75/~randy/images/favicon.png" alt="">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the following line to your Master Page at the bottom of the head section right before the </head> tag:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/images/favicon.ico"      />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check-in, publish, and approve your Master Page so that anonymous folks can see the change.</p>
<p>Refresh the site, and you should see the favicon.</p>
<p>If you have problems seeing the icon, IE could be caching it, try Firefox and it should show eventually in IE.</p>
