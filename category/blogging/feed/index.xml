										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After trying WordPress for our user group website I decided that it is a far superior blogging platform than Google&#8217;s Blogger. I&#8217;ve been meaning to move off of Blogger for a while now but was afraid of the potential hit to my Google results due to a change in URL formatting. Since coming over to Rackspace, I realized that I have access to create WordPress sites with through our cloud hosting so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find that there are tools for importing all my old posts and comments from Blogger to WordPress as well as settings to reformat the WordPress URL&#8217;s to match Bloggers URL format. I was then hopeful that I could make the move fairly seamlessly so I flipped the lever on Saturday evening (weekends are pretty slow for SharePoint web traffic). The first thing I noticed was that clicking on my Google results from my phone was taking me to the correct URL but with ?m=1 appended to the end. This was making the results fail on mobile devices so I had to make some changes to the .htaccess file. Luckily it wasn&#8217;t too difficult to find a rewriting scheme to remove the m variables.</p>
<p>So long story short, I&#8217;m hoping the move is seamless for my web traffic. If you see any problems please use my new contact form to let me know!</p>
